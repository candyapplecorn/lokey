# lokey
### LoKey implements the Google Maps API and React native to create a location-aware app for connecting strangers

## Background and Overview

## Functionality & MVP

#### Bonus Features
 + User-requested activity types
 + In-app event-oriented chat system

## Technologies & Technical Challenges
  ##### Backend: Ruby on Rails
  ##### Frontend: React Native

#### Seeding the Database
  + ##### Whitelisting Activities
    + LoKey is not a dating app. Users should not be able to post activities like "m4w 19y/o bbw pref". LoKey will initially have common activities, after which more will be added. Common activities may be like:
     - Catch
     - Sculpting
     - Painting
     - Unicycling
     - Banana Juggling

  + ##### Initial Events
    + The creators will place activities on the app's map.
    
#### Map
 + We will use Google Map's API
 + AirBnB has a [React Google Maps](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps) component which may be used.

#### Creating a seamless mobile experience
  + ##### _Including bonus MVP's_, users should be able to place & find events, and coordinate with **event hosts**, all using the app.
    + Without bonus MVP's, users should be able to place and find events, and have a means of contacting event hosts.


#### Frontend Interface
  + Implemented in React Native
  + There will be 5+ scenes including:
    - Account Creation / Signup
    - Event Creation / Edit
    - Event Show
    - User Dashboard
    - Map
  + These scenes entail creating forms in React native, as well as a filter/search bar and navbar components.

#### Backend
   + Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL will store:
     - User information
     - Events with coordinates to be displayed on a map
     - Event Types, conceptually similar to tags

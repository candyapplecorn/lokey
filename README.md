# lokey
### LoKey implements the Google Maps API and React native to create a location-aware app for connecting strangers

## Background and Overview

## Functionality & MVP

#### Bonus Features
 + User-requested activity types
 + In-app event-oriented chat system

## Technologies & Technical Challenges
  ##### Backend: Ruby on Rails
  ##### Frontend: React Native

#### Seeding the Database
  + ##### Whitelisting Activities
    + LoKey is not a dating app. Users should not be able to post activities like "m4w 19y/o bbw pref". LoKey will initially have common activities, after which more will be added.
    + Common activities may be like:
     - Catch
     - Sculpting
     - Painting
     - Unicycling
     - Banana Juggling

  + ##### Initial Events
    + The creators will place activities on the app's map.

#### Creating a seamless mobile experience
  + ##### _Including bonus MVP's_, users should be able to place & find events, and coordinate with **event hosts**, all using the app.
    + Without bonus MVP's, users should be able to place and find events, and have a means of contacting event hosts.

#### UX
  + ##### Frontend Interface
    + Implemented in React Native
    + There will be 5+ scenes including:
      - Account Creation / Signup
      - Event Creation / Edit
      - Event Show
      - User Dashboard
      - Map

  + #### Backend
    + Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL will store:
      - User information
      - Events with coordinates to be displayed on a map
      - Event Types, conceptually similar to tags

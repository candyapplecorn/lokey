I'll be following instructions from [this guide](http://mherman.org/blog/2016/09/25/node-passport-and-postgres/#.Wd-YjBOPKV5)
for setting up session-based authentication with express, passport and knex.

Once I've completed the guide's instructions I'll move on to recreating all routes from the rails server.
